This is a gameshow app for the Team Treehouse Front End Web Development tech degree. The overall font has been changed. The 
issue with the physical keyboard not disabling key selection and allowing multiple lost lives when re-selecting
a key as well as changing the Game Class Constructor to use an array of Phrases rather than simply a String array has been 
corrected. The call to the gameOver() method has been moved from the handleInteraction() method to the removeLife() method.
